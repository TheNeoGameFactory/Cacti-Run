## Who was involved in this Project?

This is simple :D there was only two Persons on this project.
[Maurehago](https://itch.io/profile/maurehago) and [The Neo GameFactory](https://the-neo-gamefactory.itch.io)

  ### Maurehago
  Maurehago made all Models for the Game, also he designed the single Level blocks that appears randomly in the game.
  
  ### The Neo GameFactory
  The Neo GameFactory also known as KillerFliege made all Scripts for the Game in GDScript.
  
  
  
## Why Godot?

We think that Godot is a great free and Open Source Engine like Blender for the Modelling Software is.
The most of you see many 2D Projects made with Godot but almost no 3D games.
That's why we decided to make a 3D game with Godot.



## Problems that came of

Yeah we had some trouble with some parts of the game.
If you already played the game you can see that there is no animations.
Everytime we played the animation the model scaled up. We used glTF as model format.
Maybe we made something wrong, or Godot has some problems with it, because other games work with Animations. We don't know.
